# Server Admin

>User-friendly server administration, for

## About This Project

Are you tired of PaaS startups rehashing old
ideas that used to be implemented for free
in the open source world?

Maybe you just like running your own server(s)?

We'll you're in luck because we are replicating 
the late, the great Mac OS X Server Admin application, 
and we're doing it on using modern web technologies. 
In this case, it happens to be VueJS, Semantic 
UI-VueJS bindings, and Python + FastAPI. All great
technologies _(you're welcome)._

I anticipate that not many of you will care or appreciate this
undertaking, and that's completely alright by me. Heck,
not even Apple cares about Mac OS X Server anymore. Still
yet, some of us are delusional enough to believe.

Server Admin - Server administration for 
_what's left of us._
